cache visited instead of distance

enable three-separators when start and goal are not separated 

use articulation points:
    * for preprocessing
    * for inprocessing
    -> split if articulation point is between start and goal
    -> prune otherwise
if that doesnt help: prune single out vertices fast (via neighborhood)

for two separators:
    * improve the max_length_ bound

improve handling for exclusion constraints in preprocessing:
    * allow more preprocessing/propagate the constraints

dag_search can only trigger if the max_length_ can actually happen
-> e.g. for 002 we have max_length_ = 39 but the longest path thats shorter has length 38
-> check if/how we can adapt max_length_ efficiently
