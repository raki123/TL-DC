for three-separators figure out what we need to do with the direct edges between the separators
    -> idea: remove them in the subgraphs but keep them afterwards as they are

use articulation points:
    * for preprocessing
    * for inprocessing
    -> split if articulation point is between start and goal
if that doesnt help: prune single out vertices fast (via neighborhood)

improve handling for exclusion constraints in preprocessing:
    * when are they actually a problem w.r.t. separating again?
    * allow more preprocessing/propagate the constraints

incorporate paralellism

dag_search can only trigger if the max_length_ can actually happen
-> e.g. for 002 we have max_length_ = 39 but the longest path thats shorter has length 38
-> check if/how we can adapt max_length_ efficiently

cache visited instead of distance
