dynamic dijkstra
cache visited instead of distance

add handling for "binary clauses" to the search:
    * enables two-separators also when start and goal are separated
    * enables three-separators when start and goal are not separated 

use articulation points:
    * for preprocessing
    * for inprocessing
    -> split if articulation point is between start and goal
    -> prune otherwise
if that doesnt help: prune single out vertices fast (via neighborhood)
