improve handling for exclusion constraints in preprocessing:
    * when are they actually a problem w.r.t. separating again?
    * allow more preprocessing/propagate the constraints

incorporate paralellism

decide what to do with dag_search:
    * currently: disable only in the presence of exclusion constraints
    * keep: fix in the presence of exclusion constraints (how?)
    * disable in general (if it just performs badly)

use some clingo options to figure out the longest path

use less memory:
    * cache visited instead of distance
    * clear cache?
    * more succinct representation of results?

order neighbors by edge-length (shortest first) to slightly improve pruning dijkstra performance

articulation points:
    * for preprocessing (doesnt actually seem to happen)
    * figure out what to do with exclusion constraints during inprocessing

dynamic dijkstra/articulation points
